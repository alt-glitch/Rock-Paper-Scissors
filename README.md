# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

### This Python program allows you to play the classical Rock-Paper-Scissors game but has the ability to read from a save file and update your score.

### As a twist, you can also add or specify your own list such as the one below and the program will automatically calculate which move takes precedence over which moves.
